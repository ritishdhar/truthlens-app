# **App Name**: ArgusVPN Landing Page

## Core Features:

- Hero Section with Glowing Arc: Visually striking hero section with a glowing arc, planets, and lens flare effects to create a futuristic and cosmic atmosphere.
- Glassmorphic Header: Floating, centered, pill-shaped header with a frosted glass effect, achieved through background blur and transparency.
- Parallax Animation: Adds a subtle parallax effect to the background elements (planets, arc, ARGUS text) to enhance depth and create a 3D feel.
- Interactive Button Animations: Engaging animations for buttons, such as glowing borders and background transitions on hover.
- Entrance Animations: Animating in header as well as glowing elements such as arc opacity, size of box-shadow, fade and zoom of ARGUS logo letters

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue/purple (#5563C1) for the glowing elements, evoking a cosmic and futuristic feel.  Derived from a cosmic and tech-noir aesthetic.
- Background color: Very dark, near-black (#0A0A1A) with a subtle radial gradient from the center to avoid flatness. Visibly related in hue to the vibrant blue primary, but heavily desaturated.
- Accent color: Bright white (#FFFFFF) for text and interactive elements, providing high contrast against the dark background. An analogous color about 30 degrees to the 'left' of the blue/purple in hue.
- Font for Headers and Body Text: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Floating centered 'pill' for header with floating ghost-style buttons, semi-transparent background and transparency.
- Subtle shimmer across the arc in set intervals
- Pulsating glow: animating blur-radius of main arc, subtly in a loop.
